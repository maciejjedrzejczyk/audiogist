# AudioGist Batch Processing Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented batch processing functionality for AudioGist, allowing users to process multiple YouTube videos in parallel. This implementation follows the design principles outlined in the README.md and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.

## Key Features Added

1. **Parallel Processing**: Uses Python's `concurrent.futures` to process multiple YouTube videos simultaneously
2. **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress with a progress bar and status updates
3. **Configurable Settings**: Includes all the same configuration options as single video processing
4. **Organized Results**: Displays results in expandable sections for easy navigation
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles failures for individual videos without stopping the batch process

## Implementation Details

### Added Dependencies
- Added `concurrent.futures` for parallel processing

### Batch Processing UI
- Created a two-column layout similar to the single video processing tab
- Added all the same configuration options with unique keys to avoid state conflicts
- Implemented a text area for entering multiple YouTube URLs (one per line)
- Added a slider to control the number of parallel downloads

### Processing Logic
- Parses the input text to extract valid URLs
- Creates a ThreadPoolExecutor with the specified number of workers
- Processes each URL in parallel, updating progress as each completes
- Collects and displays results in an organized manner

### Results Display
- Shows success/failure status for each video
- Provides expandable sections for each processed video
- Displays transcript and summary in a two-column layout
- Includes download buttons for both transcript and summary files

## Usage Instructions

1. Go to the "Batch Processing" tab
2. Enter multiple YouTube URLs (one per line) in the text area
3. Select the language for all videos
4. Adjust advanced settings as needed:
   - AI Backend (Ollama or LM Studio)
   - Model selection
   - Whisper model size
   - YouTube auto-generated captions option
   - Custom prompt (optional)
   - Token limit and chunk overlap settings
5. Set the number of parallel downloads (1-5)
6. Click "Process All Videos"
7. Monitor progress in the progress bar
8. View and interact with results as they appear

## Error Handling

- Each video is processed independently
- Failures in one video don't affect the processing of others
- Error messages are displayed in the results section
- Detailed errors are logged to the application log file

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the batch processing feature:

1. Add ability to save/load batch processing results
2. Implement pause/resume functionality for large batches
3. Add option to export all results as a single report
4. Provide more detailed progress information per video
5. Add filtering and sorting options for batch results
